## Client Next.js 13.4 (app directory) authorization with two tokens by RED Group.

**Stack:** Next.js 13.4 / GraphQL / Apollo / Jotai / TypeScript

This is not an ideal version of authorization, it is just a foundation. When you integrate into your project, please do refactoring!

_The back-end is written separately in nestjs, it is very simple and you can write it based on client requests. It was important for me to share the client side._

For run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
